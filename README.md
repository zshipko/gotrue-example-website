# GoTrue Example

This is a basic website built using [gotrue](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue) and [gotrue-js](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue-js)

Set the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITLAB_CLIENT_ID` and `BITBUCKET_CLIENT_ID` variables in `js/main.js` to match your configured API keys on the server.
